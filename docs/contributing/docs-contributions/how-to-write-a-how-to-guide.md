## What is a How-To Guide?

A How-To Guide is a practical step-by-step guide that helps readers achieve a specific goal. How-To Guides are most useful when readers want to get something done.

A How-To Guide should:

- Include a list of steps to help readers accomplish a specific task.
  - This should include code snippets to show exactly what readers should type.
-

- For more information on how-to guides, check out the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/), which the Gatsby docs are based on.

- When to write a How-To Guide?
  - How-To Guides work well for procedures that readers need to follow. For example
- How How-To Guides relate to and differ from other doc types (e.g. Reference Guide, Tutorial)

## How-To Guide Template

A How-To Guide should include the following sections:

- **Introduction:** Provide some quick background information to help readers understand 1) what this How-To Guide will help them achieve and 2) why that's useful.
- **Prerequisites:** Any additional information or setup readers will have to do before they can make use of this How-To Guide.
- **Directions:**
- **Additional Resources:** Links to other docs or content that might be useful next steps for readers. Also, any resources that helped you write the How-To Guide.

// TODO: Update one of the existing How-To Guides to match this new template. List it as an exemplar. Ideally, do at least 2-3, for a variety of examples.

## Introduction

The introductory paragraph should be a 1-2 sentence explanation of the main
topic and answer the following questions:

What is the purpose of this guide? What will readers have achieved by following the steps in this guide?

## Prerequisites

If applicable, list any prerequisites to reading and understanding your article.

Does the reader need to read another document first, install a particular plugin, or already know a certain skill? List those things here.

## Directions

This section should be a step-by-step list of instructions for how readers can achieve the goal.

1. Do the first thing.
2. Do the next thing.

If it's a particularly long list of directions, you can split the steps into sections. Use subheadings to label each chunk. For example:

### Step 1: Do the first thing.

1. The first step of the first thing.
1. The second step of the first thing.

### Step 2: Do some other thing.

1. The first step of some other thing.
1. The second step of some other thing.

## Additional Resources

If there are other resources you think readers would benefit from or next steps they might want to take after reading your article, add them at the bottom in an "Other Resources" section. You can also mention here any resources that helped you write the article (blog posts, outside tutorials, etc.).

- Link to a blog post
- Link to a YouTube tutorial
- Link to an example site
- Link to source code for a live site
- Links to relevant plugins
- Links to starters

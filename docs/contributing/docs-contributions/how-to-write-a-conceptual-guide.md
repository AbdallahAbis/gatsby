## What is a Conceptual Guide?

- Focus: Giving more context on the big picture. Might compare and contrast multiple approaches or similar topics.

A good Conceptual Guide should:

- Provide context.
- Discuss alternatives and opinions.

> For more information on Conceptual Guides, check out the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/), which the Gatsby docs are based on.

> **Note:** In the Divio system, these types of docs are called "Explanations" instead of "Conceptual Guides."

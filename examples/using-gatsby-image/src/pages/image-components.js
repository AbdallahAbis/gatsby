    <p>
      The default Blur Up technique uses progressive loading to make a fast,
      visually pleasing experience without waiting for a full-resolution image
      with a blank screen.
    </p>
    <h2>Progressive Loading with Minimal Effort</h2>
    <p>
      The magic of Gatsby Image's Blur Up technique means that you can load an
      image at moderate resolution and not have to bother with creating a small
      thumbnail yourself. Gatsby Image will automatically create a tiny image
      from your source image and load it first for quick display while the
      larger image file is downloaded and displayed. Users first see a blurry
      lower-resolution image to help with perceived performance, while the
      larger image downloads and everything works automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technique is the default behavior when querying for an image with
      GraphQL or using StaticImage.
